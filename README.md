# Empowering Developers with Platform Engineering

Mark Harrison : 24 March 2024  

## Introduction

"Platform Engineering" has recently surfaced as a hot topic. It represents an evolution / amalgamation of various software development and infrastructure practises.  Its core aim is to accelerate the delivery of applications and the pace at which they generate business value.

Writing this document serves as a tool for deepening my understanding of this evolving domain and its recent advancements.   Whilst I have considerable experience in many of the underlying topics discussed - the main goal for writing this is to enhance my knowledge and ability to articulate clearly on the subject.  

If the document is useful to others thats great - but the primary audience remains myself.  Feedback welcome / appreciated.
